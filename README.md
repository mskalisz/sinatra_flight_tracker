# Flight Tracking App

A flight tracking application that allows a user to enter the airline, flight number, destination, and departure time for a flight.

Some things to think about:
- Store data in a user's session or a file
- Add validations to validate values submitted via forms (including flash messages)
- Keep shared content in a layout

Should be able to 
- write a Ruby application using Sinatra
- write enough ERB code to display your application in a browser.
- create Gemfile and Gemfile.lock files so your grader can run the code on their system
- provide the SQL needed to create and seed any databases you require.
- you do not need CSS if you do not want to use it. We do not require a pretty application for this project.
- save your project in a zip file and upload it after completing the project
